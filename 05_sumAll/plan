how would i make a sum of between all value of elements in an array

1. identify the min and max values
2. find every integer between the min and max values (use a for loop for this)
3. add all the integers between the min and max value ( need to have accumaltor and elements and reducer)
4. remove negative
5. remove non integer
6. revmove non-number parameters like strings and arrays
